    <h2>Desciption</h2>
    <p>This is the best French toast recipe. It's different because it uses flour. I have given it to some friends and they've all liked it better than the French toast they usually make!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>¼ cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 cup milk</li>
            <li>3 large eggs</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon white sugar</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
            <li>1 pinch salt</li>
            <li>12 thick slices bread</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <p>
        <ol>
            <li>Measure flour into a large mixing bowl. Slowly whisk in milk. Whisk in eggs, sugar, vanilla extract, cinnamon, and salt until smooth.</li>
            <li>Heat a lightly oiled griddle or frying pan over medium heat. Meanwhile, soak bread slices in milk mixture until saturated.</li>
            <li>Working in batches, cook bread on the preheated griddle or pan until golden brown on each side.</li>
            <li>Serve hot and enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
